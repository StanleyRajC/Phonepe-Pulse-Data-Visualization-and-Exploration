# Phonepe-data-visualisation
This GitHub repository contains five years of PhonePe transaction data, ranging from 2018 to 2022, providing insights on user behavior and transaction patterns across the country. The data is comprehensive, covering a diverse range of users and transactions, and can be used for various analytical purposes.
This project is a data analysis and visualization tool that utilizes various packages such as 

os,json,pandas,streamlit,plotly and psycopg2

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the five-year transaction data (2018-2022) obtained from PhonePe's GitHub repository.

The project starts by cloning the data from the GitHub repository and reading it using the os package. Once the data is read, it is stored in a PostgreSQL database using the psycopg2 package. This ensures that the data is easily accessible and can be queried efficiently.

The data is then analyzed and visualized using the plotly and streamlit packages. The data is presented in various graph formats such as aggregated transactions, users, top transactions, and users for state, pincode, and district. The streamlit webpage allows the user to interact with the data and explore the different graphs, allowing for a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns within the data.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of PhonePe's transaction data, allowing for insights into the growth and trends of digital payments in India over the past five years.
